HIDKey
======

Based on [HIDKeys](http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/hidkeys.html) of [V-USB](http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html),
which is for Atmel ATmega8.

Current master branch is configured for [AT90S2313](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=1993) which is actually discontinued product.
The code is almost same as original code but changed number of keys, IO ports etc.
Also added a project for AVR Studio 4 with WinAVR.
I'm using them on VMware fusion but we may able to use similar tools like [CrossPack for AVR Development](http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html).
